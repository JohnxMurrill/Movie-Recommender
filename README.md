# Movie Recommender

A work-in-progress movie recommendation system that generates personalized movie lists for users using an ensemble of machine learning models.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust, scalable movie recommendation service. Recommendations are generated by combining predictions from multiple ML models (collaborative filtering, content-based, and more) in an ensemble architecture. The system is designed for extensibility and cloud deployment.

## Key Features
- **Ensemble Recommendation Engine:** Combines predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.
- **Asynchronous Prediction:** Model predictions are run asynchronously and combined in a controller for fast, scalable recommendations.
- **Cloud-Ready:** Designed to support running model inference via an API on AWS Lambda (or similar cloud services).
- **Modular Design:** Easily add new models to the ensemble by implementing them in the `models/` directory.
- **Rich Feature Engineering:** Includes advanced preprocessing for both movies and users, leveraging genres, tags, meta-tags, embeddings, and user interaction history.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering includes:
- Creation of an extensive user feature table (demographics, genre preferences, meta-tags, etc.)
- Movie feature table (genres, tags, embeddings, awards, etc.)
- User-movie interaction matrix (implicit and explicit feedback, confidence scaling)

## Models
### Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
Matrix factorization model for implicit feedback, uncovering latent factors that explain observed user-movie interactions.

### Logistic Matrix Factorization (LMF)
Probabilistic matrix factorization model optimized for implicit feedback.

### Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
Pairwise ranking model that optimizes for personalized ranking of movies for each user.

### XGBoost
Gradient boosting model trained on a subset of the data, used for hybrid recommendation and feature importance analysis.

### Content and Collaborative Filtering
Combines content-based features (genres, tags, embeddings) with collaborative filtering models for improved recommendations.
