# Movie Recommender

A work-in-progress movie recommendation system that generates personalized movie lists for users using an ensemble of machine learning models.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust, scalable movie recommendation service. Recommendations are generated by combining predictions from multiple ML models (collaborative filtering, content-based, and more) in an ensemble architecture. The system is designed for extensibility and cloud deployment.

## Key Features
- **Ensemble Recommendation Engine:** Combines predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.
- **Asynchronous Prediction:** Model predictions are run asynchronously and combined in a controller for fast, scalable recommendations.
- **Cloud-Ready:** Designed to support running model inference via an API on AWS Lambda (or similar cloud services).
- **Modular Design:** Easily add new models to the ensemble by implementing them in the `models/` directory.
- **Rich Feature Engineering:** Includes advanced preprocessing for both movies and users, leveraging genres, tags, meta-tags, embeddings, and user interaction history.
